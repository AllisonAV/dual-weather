dual-weather,  to be renamed weather-routes

Have you ever need to see weather in multiple locations at once?

Weather-Routes is a place where you can enter in two locations and see side by side weather comparisons on the same screen

Weather-Routes will be deployed in the near future, after issues with too many hits per minute using the key are resolved.
